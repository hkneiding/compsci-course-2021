# CompSci Course 2021 - Project 1: Regression, Classification and Resampling Methods

Repository for the first project in the CompSci PhD program.

Here, we deal with methods for simple regression (OLS, Ridge, Lasso) and classification (Logistic regression, support vector machines) tasks. Furthermore, we employed two different resampling methods, namely Bootstrap and Cross-Validation, for our analyses.
